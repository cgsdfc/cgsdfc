### Hi, I'm Cong Feng

I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, Beijing.

I have a solid foundation in the basic of Computer Science, including Operation Systems, Compilers, and Computer Organizations. I can write C++ in multi-threaded, asynchronous environments, with sufficient knowledge of C++'s type system, template deduction, etc. I also know Java, Kotlin, Android development, and PyQt development. I have in-depth knowledge of Python, including commonly-used libraries (stdlib, pandas, sklearn, etc), language features (data-classes, f-strings, etc), deep-learning frameworks (pytorch, etc), and some basic knowledge of the interpreter. I can adapt to a new language or codebase relatively fast.

I have some research experience, including a publication in the Journal of Communication or 通讯学报 (CCF-B, IE-indexed) and a submission to Wireless Networks (CCF-C, SCI-indexed). The research direction of my master's degree is Multi-view Clustering with low-quality data, which includes view-unaligned data and incomplete multi-view data. Thus, I am quite familiar with clustering, unsupervised learning, multi-view learning, information fusion, etc.

I am currently looking for a Ph.D. post in the field of AI/DL/ML, especially in Transformers, Universal Language Modeling, Cross-modal Learning, and other Deep Learning fields with real-world interests. I am self-motivated and passionate. Feel free to contact me directly if you are looking for perspective students with industrial backgrounds and good engineering skills.
