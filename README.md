### Hi, I'm Cong Feng

I am currently a formal intern (as opposed to an outsourced intern) at the OCR team, Department of Visual Technology, Baidu Inc., Beijing. I am also pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University, Beijing.

I have a solid foundation in the basic of Computer Science, including Operation Systems, Compilers, and Computer Organizations. I can write C++ in multi-threaded, asynchronous environments, with sufficient knowledge of C++'s type system, template deduction, etc. I also know Java, Kotlin, Android development, and PyQt development. I have in-depth knowledge of Python, including commonly-used libraries (stdlib, pandas, sklearn, etc), language features (dataclasses, f-strings, etc), deep-learning frameworks (pytorch, etc), and some basic knowledge of the interpreter. I can adapt to a new language or codebase relatively fast.

I have some research experience, including a publication at the Journal of Communication or 通讯学报 (CCF-B, IE-indexed) and a submission to Wireless Networks (CCF-C). My research direction of my master degree is Multi-view clustering with complex multi-view data, which includes view-unaligned data and incomplete multi-view data.

I am currently looking for a PhD or Master's post in the field of AI/DL/ML, especially in Transformers, Universal Language Modeling, Cross-modal Learning, and other Deep Learning fields with real-world interests.
